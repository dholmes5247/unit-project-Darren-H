      <h2>About This App</h2>
      <p>This app aims to connect learners with materials that can reinforce their learning
      through true/false questions and instant feedback.  In my Launchcode course we play a game called "kahoot"
      that helps reinforce knowledge covered in the modules and it is beneficial.  I hoped putting together a version
      of that would help me learn in doing and coming up with questions.</p>
