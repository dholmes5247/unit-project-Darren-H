      <h2>&nbsp;About Me & This App:&nbsp; </h2>
      <p className="about">
        This app aims to connect learners with materials that can reinforce their learning
        through true/false questions and instant feedback.
        <br /><br />
        In my LaunchCode course, we play a game called <b><em>Kahoot</em></b> to reinforce knowledge
        from the modules — its been incredibly beneficial for me. I built this app to learn
        by doing and to share a tool that might help others too.  I have ideas for many add-ons
        including: more questions, different subject areas, more links to external sites etc.  
        If you have any  ideas please email me using the link below in the footer.
        <br /><br />
        Just like watching film and running practices from my coaching days, building websites helps me
        understand what I have been learning and tie it all together.  You never know what you
        will find within projects...
